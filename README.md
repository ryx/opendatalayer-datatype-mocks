# OpenDatalayer datatype mocks
This module contains helpers to generate stub data for testing [OpenDatalayer](https://github.com/ryx/opendatalayer) features.
That way we can keep all stub data in one place and reuse it throughout multiple unit tests.

## Usage
Import as library and use the provided methods to receive mock objects for the individual [ODL datatypes](https://github.com/ryx/opendatalayer-model-default).
